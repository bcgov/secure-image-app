The provisioning profile and distribution certificate have been encrypted with gpg:
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 AppleDistribution.p12
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 SecureImage__In_House.mobileprovision

The password used for the encryption has been added to github secrets. It is used in the workflow to decrypt and add the files to the keychain to allow for the code to be signed and exported.

The ios workflow is as follows:
- Checkout repository
- Install gpg: 
	used to decrypt the profile and certificate
- Install xcpretty: 
	helps us see more useful logs when running the xcode commands
- Setup provisioning profile: 
	decrypts profile and certificates and them to keychain
- Archive project: 
	creates an SecureImage.xcarchive file 
- Export .ipa:
	exports the acrhived project and create the .ipa app file
	here we use the specification in ios/exportOptions-adhoc.plist file to describe how the code is signed
- Upload .ipa:
	uploads the generated .ipa file using actions/upload-artifact@v1
