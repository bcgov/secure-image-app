# TL;DR

This sub-directory contains the Android app that is one of the three components to the application suite. The following document will illustrate key configuration for development and release.

# Local Development

This document assumes the reader is using a device with at least OpenJDK 1.8 and Android Studio installed. This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) for package management. 

Make the following config changes for local development or production releases:

Open the file `keystore.properties` and edit the values as needed. For example, if you are running the API locally update `DEBUG_SERVER_URL` to point to your local instance as per the API docs there.

```
FABRIC_API_KEY = 4dc0080275145d547109096fa1840eabb6bd5104
DEBUG_SERVER_URL = \"http://api-devex-mpf-secure-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/\"
SSO_BASE_URL = \"https://dev-sso.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/\"
SSO_REALM_NAME = \"mobile\"
SSO_AUTH_ENDPOINT = \"https://dev-sso.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/auth/realms/mobile/protocol/openid-connect/auth\"
SSO_REDIRECT_URI = \"bcgov://android\"
SSO_CLIENT_ID = \"secure-image\"
SSO_HINT = \"idir\"
```


At this point you will be able to run the app on an Android device for development. The Android application will use the `DEBUG_SERVER_URL` to communicate with the API.

Pro Tip ðŸ¤“: 
* Make sure you set these values correctly prior to a production build and release; don't ship dev config.
* Mobile applications need to be signed with our corporate certificates prior to release. Search for `signing` at the [DevHub](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/) for more information on the process.

## CICD Pipeline

This project is configured to run tests automatically via a GitHub Actions [workflow](../.github/workflows/android.yml). Make changes as needed
